# newLogoGenerator
The purpose of this lab is to build a Node.js comand-line application that will take user input and generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The app will provide prompts for the user in order to take in 3 letter text, shape, color, and text color. The app should take in color in both name and hexadecimal form. It should also have test cases that shows that the app passed them all.
